# PACMAN Game
This is a simplified PACMAN game.
Use arrows to control pacman movements, obstacles are labels with '#' and coins are labels using '.'
What's special about this game? After eating 10 coins, the ghost will start escaping from the player. 
In original PACMAN game, ghost in panic mode will escape from player with random path. However, 
I implemented an algorithm for ghosts which allows them to escape player using an optimized route. 
User will never catch the ghosts given the speed of user is equal or slower than the ghosts.
